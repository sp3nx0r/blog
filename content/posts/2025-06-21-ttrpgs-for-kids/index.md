**Want to introduce your kids to the magical world of tabletop role-playing games, but don't know where to start or think you can do it?** Whether you're a seasoned DM or a complete beginner, this article will walk you through what worked for me for how to create engaging, age-appropriate TTRPG experiences that grow with your children.

After running TTRPG sessions with my own kids for years (from ages 5 to 10), I've developed a system that adapts to their cognitive development while keeping the magic alive. This article covers everything from choosing the right materials to running your first campaign.

## Minis Are Magical

### Starting Young

When my kids were little, I started out getting some D&D mini figures (minis or minifigs) to help them visualize things. It's tough when they're sub seven years old because their imagination is very much based on visual stimulus and the free-form creations aren't quite there yet. This is where the minis are great, they can see what an owlbear is, or a drider, or a storm giant, or any host of other things. And the best part is they're relatively inexpensive (for the non-painted ones anyway), and my kids loved collecting them -- they used to be go-tos for presents when they were younger. And if you get the chonky bois, then they're pretty resistant to damage as the resins are relatively strong -- be careful on the fragile models, and maybe reserve that for when they're older and/or more responsible. And as the prevalence of 3D printing is coming along, this is also a viable route if you don't mind taking a more hands-on approach.

### Stick Minis On A Map

Now that we had some minis in their possession, here's how I'd use them. I bought a [Chessex Battle Map](https://www.amazon.com/Chessex-Role-Playing-Play-Mat/dp/B0015IQO2O) that I'd doodle little scenes into with colored wet erase markers. I'd always have a little camp with tents and (poorly drawn) horses and some shrubs that we'd start their adventure at. Then I'd just let my imagination run wild and create a few more stops along their journey:

* a **WaReHoUsE oF dOoM** - a couple of 3d rectangles with some trees
* a **bridge over a river** that almost always had a troll or other critter underneath
* a **dark wizard's tower** - duh
* always ending at the **purple Temple of Evil** - entered through a secret door in the tower

We'd progress their little character minis from stop to stop and do a little combat or light roleplaying or puzzle, with me keeping an eye on the attention span and fun-o-meter and moving on or changing things up when I noticed either starting to wane (more on these topics later). At each stop, there'd inevitably be a critter to fight (either I'd pick randomly or the kids would pick who they wanted to battle before we start and I'd weave their choices into the story). Nothing is more fun than slamming down a huge honking monsters for them to fight! And eventually when the monster is slain, we tip them over in defeat.

## D&D Kids' Books

As they got older and started to read decently (around 1st grade), we also bought the [Young Adventurer's Guides Series](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/series/EJB/dungeons-and-dragons-young-adventurers-guides/) for them. These are actually all great little books that help build foundational knowledge of D&D lore, mechanics, and archetypes, or help to explain the character classes (like barbarian or wizard), or describe common monsters they'd end up fighting (like that owlbear), even up to different types of dragons and legendary monsters. My younger son loved the pictures and the older one would read the words for his brother, helping develop their reading skills and vocabulary too! They're great reference materials and often get pulled out when we play. The official D&D Player's Handbook is a bit too much for the 10 year old, but these books are perfect bite sized vignettes of D&D that get them familiar with words I use or mechanics I introduce. Highly recommend getting any or all of these, specially as the boxed sets. My wife literally had to duct tape the spine back together on [Wizards & Spells](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/603901/wizards-and-spells-dungeons-and-dragons-by-jim-zub-with-stacy-king-and-andrew-wheeler-official-dungeons-and-dragons-licensed/) that's how much they get used!

## Combat / Actions with Kids

There's plenty of well written guides / PDFs that talk about various ways to run these. Like Wizard's own [Monster Slayers](https://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/MonsterSlayers_v3.pdf) for ages 6 and up. Heck, [this great article by TTRPGkids](https://www.ttrpgkids.com/2022/03/08/dd-5e-for-kids-a-sortable-list-of-adventures-hacks-rewrites-and-supplements/). Plenty of articles and references exist here that I referenced in preparation for playing with my kids. Here's what ended up working well for me and mine.

### Starting with D6s

When they were littler, we had a giant jar of foam d6 dice that we'd use. Foam because they're great for chucking around the room and you don't have to worry about tiny little dice disappearing under a couch or fine motor skills not being up to the task. I'd use a simple d6 strategy of the following:

| Roll | Result         | Description                                                         |
|------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Epic Failure   | Something hilarious happens; the action fails in a big way.         |
| 2    | Failure        | The action doesn't go off as they had desired.                      |
| 3-4  | Mixed Result   | The action happens, but with some negative effect.                  |
| 5    | Success        | The action goes off just as they described.                         |
| 6    | Epic Success   | The action works even better than they described.                   |

I wouldn't even worry about a difficulty class for what they were going up against, just having this simple framework was something they (and I) could easily understand and get immediate understanding of what happened when they rolled. I found this more engaging than me arbitrarily deciding if it works or not because, as they are younger like 7-9, they stay engaged and can equate the roll of the dice to what happens in the world.

### Graduate to Difficulty Classes

Now, I changed this as they got older and understood the concept of difficulty classes. I bought them both a fancy dice set of their own (to eliminate fighting and teach responsibility for their possessions) and we eventually graduated to d20s. So how this works is, after hearing what they wanted to do, I'd throw out a difficulty class (sometimes out loud or to myself, depending on the level of mystery) to hit or exceed, and they'd get the satisfying tactile experience of rolling a d20 and doing basic less than / greater than maths. This also had the benefit of teaching them constraints of their character - if you wanted to jump 30 feet in the air unaided, then that'll be a 30+ roll required (never going to happen). I'd let them reconsider and pick another action. This taught them how to play within the confines of the rules / reality, helping them realize their character was not a god or superhuman (we're playing high fantasy here), and then pick actions that are more reasonable or aligned with their character (like a barbarian trying to cast a spell wouldn't really go over well).

A very simple framework for this would be:

| DC  | Difficulty Level        | Description                                                                                   |
|-----|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 5   | Trivial                 | Very easy to do (but kinda funny if they botch it)                                          |
| 10  | Easy/Familiar           | Something they know how to do, or an easy task, depending on the action or monster            |
| 15  | Moderate                | Moderately difficult but within reason                                                        |
| 20  | Nearly Impossible       | Pretty much impossible, but if you get a Nat20 then the gods smiled on you and YOLO           |

Playing with plusses and minuses can be confusing for them, so I opt to adjust that math in my head. If you're a barbarian doing a rage attack against a goblin, sure a 10 sounds great as that's something you should know how to do and a goblin isn't too hard. Now if it's a beefier monster or the BBEG, then sure that'll be a higher difficulty class. And I've read [this treatise from Mythlands](https://mythlands-erce.blogspot.com/2023/10/how-difficulty-class-and-d20-engine.html) about how difficulty classes and the d20 is ruining roleplaying, and I kinda agree, but this setup works well for my kids so screw it, use what works and IS FUN.

This works for combat rolls (i.e. does your attack hit the monster) and action rolls (i.e. do you find / disarm a trap, or does your character know the ancient runes written on the door). I like to introduce the D&D verbiage for their checks (like "perception" or "dexterity" checks) to give it a name and to help them understand *what* is being checked. Older kids will play to their strengths or have their friend who is the thief do the traps check and so on.

### ⚔️ Combat Tips

* Use simplified actions (Attack, Cast, Item, Dodge).
* Use terrain! Crumbling balconies, torch sconces, traps.
* Enemies do cool things but clearly telegraph them ("The Hollow Duke lifts his sword, charging shadow energy — what do you do!?")

## Classes and Characters

### Window Shopping for Classes

When my kids started off, we simply picked characters out of the [Young Adventurer's Weapons & Warriors](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/603899/warriors-and-weapons-dungeons-and-dragons-by-jim-zub-with-stacy-king-and-andrew-wheeler-official-dungeons-and-dragons-licensed/) that they thought were "cool". I'd summarize what their archetype typically did (their strengths and weaknesses, like barbarian is super strong and smashes things, but isn't too bright; or, mages cast super awesome spells but they're kinda squishy) and they'd pick based on vibes. We got little minis closely resembling their class too (pre-painted because we fancy). Races are a bit much when they're young, so I'd stick to the races that typically played that class - so mages would be elves, barbarians would be orcs or humans. You know, typically the ones that had the best racial boons or stat bonuses that made sense, or the ones portrayed in stories or media. My youngest really loved being a Halfling too, for some reason -- being a tiny stabby guy was right up his alley. This worked real well when they were little and starting out.

### Pre-made Characters - Limit The Options

Eventually, I graduated them to pre-made characters. So still shaping what they could do and the general archetype and feel, but letting them experience different classes and playstyles. I'd introduce more and more components of a typical character sheet too. I started out with letting them pick a name and a class to add their own personalization, then introduced HP and eventually armor. These were simple numbers, taking from Heroscape or One Door Dungeon, that would be added/subtracted in small amounts based on the events in the story. But no need to do crazy maths or roll all the dice, we'd just work on token based damage and the armor, for example, might negate damage from an enemy even if they rolled well.

### Limited Skillsets and Sunderfolk's Influence

We've played a BUNCH of [Sunderfolk](https://www.dreamhaven.com/games/sunderfolk) (great game, love it btw), and their concept of skills being a handful of cards you could play really resonated with my kids. So now I'm introducing a grabbag of skills that they can pick from during the session, typically aligned with a Movement, Combat, and Special Move trifecta. This helps prevent the "every time is fireball" scenario that eventually started happening with the oldest's wizard, where the skills would get kinda stale. Introducing these pre-made skills in a limited quantity is setting them on the path of a D&D level character customization that they'll eventually get to -- it's too much preparation that I want to do for now.

### Bonus: *Flaw* Concepts and Personalization

Something that the kids ended up LOVING was the *Flaw* concept -- what was the one weird quirk or problem with their character that they wanted to roleplay? I threw this in on a whim and wasn't sure what I'd get, but they remembered this aspect so strongly after several sessions. One was really fond of money and would do anything for it. Another was they couldn't pronounce *Worcestershire sauce* which they made GREAT use of during the tavern roleplay. It's just another way for the kid to put their own unique stamp on the character. I'd give them ideas if they couldn't think of one, and would make sure it wasn't anything inappropriate or hurtful (don't want to be ableist or judgmental).

## Building A Session

### AI Prompting to Start

So now the hardest part of all of this: deciding what story they're actually going to play! Now, again, there's plenty of pre-made adventures / stories you can find on Reddit or elsewhere, but eventually you'll need to start making your own. Good news is that GenAI can help those who are typically unimaginative or nervous about writing their own story. Below is a [customized prompt that I sourced from RPG Prompts](https://www.rpgprompts.com/post/dungeons-dragons-chatgpt-prompt) that I'd use to start the framework of the story. I almost always build sessions in three sections: roleplay, puzzle, combat. You can swap around the order, but these three classic elements are the essentials for a good session, so you can't go wrong.

{{< callout type="ChatGPT Prompt for D&D Session Generation" >}}
Stop being an AI model. You're a professional Dungeon Master. You're crafting a campaign for a group of 10 year old boys at a sleepover, so this should be a one-shot campaign.

GAME: Dungeons & Dragons: 5th Edition

BOOKS: Any Random Campaign Book

ROLE: Dungeon Master

THEME: High Fantasy

TONALITY: Gritty & Heroic

AUDIENCE: A group of 10 year old boys

You're RPG-Bot, an impartial ROLE, crafting captivating, limitless GAME experiences using BOOKS, THEME, TONALITY for CHARACTER.

RPG-Bot's General Responsibilities Include:

* Tell compelling stories in TONALITY for my CHARACTER.
* Use GAME's core and BOOKS knowledge but tuned for ease of understanding for the AUDIENCE.
* Generate settings, places, and years, adhering to THEME and TONALITY, and naming GAME elements (except AUDIENCE).
* Use bolding, italics or other formatting when appropriate
* Paint vivid pictures of encounters and settings.
* Balance role-play, combat, and puzzles. All three should be present in the story.
* Inject humor, wit, and distinct storytelling.
* Avoid adult content: relationships, love, intimacy, and associated narratives.
* Craft varied NPCs, ranging from good to evil.
* Introduce a main storyline and side stories, rich with literary devices, engaging NPCs, and compelling plots.
* Inject humor into interactions and descriptions.
{{< /callout >}}

Tune the above prompt based on your needs and age range, but I found this gave me a great framework to play with. You slap this puppy in ChatGPT and let it go to work. Don't like a particular element or theme? Adjust it with some feedback to the LLM and you've got a winner.

I really like using ChatGPT for this because it formats it in Markdown and it copies over to my text editor of choice *with* the formatting (section headers, bolding character names / other proper nouns, etc.). I'll tweak the campaign in ChatGPT until I get it 80% to my liking, then pull it over to a text editor to put the finishing touches on it.

### Editorial Flair - The Real Work

Next, I'll read through what it wrote, and nitpick certain parts:

* Don't like the name of an NPC? Rename it, or ask your editor's LLM to give you some other possible options.
* Want to have it write the introductory speech that the town's mayor (or *insert other NPC doing the springboard for the story here*) that you can read to players? Generate that.
* Want to generate random loot ideas that a merchant might have? You could consult a table and roll, or just let the LLM roll its bytes to determine them.
* Want to add monsters to the dungeon? Give it some feedback on the type of monster or what the environ is the monster will occupy and see what the LLM gives you.
* Want to have a puzzle and also let the NPC give hints that the characters have to connect together themselves? Ask it to generate a puzzle to your liking, tweaking all the while.
* Want it to make a map of a dungeon? It'll generate an ASCII map that is great at visualization and planning! (See the example below - the first generated map had a "Stairway Down" but didn't go anywhere, so I asked it to make a second floor in the same context and it picked it right up.)

In general, my concept here is that I'm letting the LLM write 80% of the work with me nudging it in the right direction, or making specific edits on high value components like names or themes or tone. I was able to piece together a campaign in under an hour using the above framework and tweaking the content in Cursor, using gpt-4.1 model along the way and `Ctrl+K`ing my way to victory. I will note that I'm not just blindly letting the LLMs write anything, I'm proofreading and making sure it fits my audience, theme, and vibe that I'm going for -- essentially playing the editor to the LLM's rough draft.

## Delivering the Session

So I wrote this campaign I'm referencing down below for a sleepover with six of our neighborhood's 10 year old boys. I'm going to bring my various sets of dice (including the foam d6s in case anyone wants to go this path), and I've got minis for the skeletal soldiers, drider, and boss monster. I'm bringing my map as well to draw out the ASCII map that ChatGPT generated for me, to show them where they've explored and where they can go, and move their little team forward. And all the while, I'll be watching the kids and making sure we're having fun. Does someone seem quiet? Let's see what THEY want to do and make sure they're involved. Someone seem unhappy that their action didn't go as planned? Reinforce this is part of the story, and even in life everything doesn't go the way you'd like it too (and maybe get them a popsicle).

### Character Sheets - Something to Hold

I also printed out character sheets with the info of the pre-made characters down below. I had [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app) whip up some images based on the character description/skills (I just copypasta'd the Markdown block of character info all at once in and it generated me six images) that I included on the sheet to catch the kids' eye. I also left them a **Notes** section where they can take notes, track damage taken, write down loot received, do whatever they want. I'll bring a handful of pencils and let them do their thing.

### Extra Special Touches

My Markdown file of actual campaign I ended up running is [down below](#appendix-the-actual-session). I opened this in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) on my iPhone. I also had a speaker paired with my phone to play audio cues from [Tabletopy](https://tabletopy.com/) and music from [Tabletop Audio](https://tabletopaudio.com/). I ended up cutting the **Light the Brazier of Black Flame** puzzle and **Silken the Drider** combat as we were starting to run long. But it was a lot of fun having the riddles and clues from **Old Maev** come back to be relevant in the combat section, the boys really enjoyed that.

## Common Questions and Solutions

**Q: My kids are fighting over dice/miniatures. What should I do?**

A: Prepare ahead by having each child with their own die and assign specific miniatures (or make a rule that only YOU can move the minis). Remind them actions have consequences, even in the game by giving them a little lightning bolt to the face, for example.

**Q: How many kids should be in the adventuring party?**

A: 3-4 is the sweet spot. The more you have, the more chaos you will have to control. Some kids might not be able to hold their attention while someone else is taking their turn.

**Q: How long should sessions be?**

A: Start with 30-45 minutes for young children (5-7), gradually increasing to 1-2 hours for older kids (8+). Watch for signs of fatigue or boredom. Take breaks between Acts or logical pauses. Get the wiggles out.

**Q: What if my child gets upset when they fail a roll?**

A: Emphasize that failure is part of the story and often leads to interesting outcomes. Use humor and remind them that even heroes face setbacks.

**Q: How do I handle different age groups playing together?**

A: Use the older child's system but give younger children advantages (like rolling with advantage or having a "helper" NPC). Don't just always let them win, this is a great learning opportunity. There's fun in failure.

## Final Thoughts

Running TTRPGs with kids is one of the most rewarding experiences I've had as a parent. Watching their imaginations come alive, seeing them work together to solve problems, and hearing them excitedly retell their adventures days later -- makes this old man proud.

The key is to start simple and let the complexity grow naturally with your children. Don't worry about getting everything "right" according to official rules. Focus on fun, engagement, and creating memorable experiences.

Remember: You're not just running a game; you're building a foundation for creativity, critical thinking, and family bonding that will last a lifetime.
