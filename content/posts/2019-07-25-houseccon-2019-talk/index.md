Been a long time since I've updated this site, but finally got around to having time to add my con talk here.

I spoke at HouSecCon 2019 about my experience building out an offensive security department for my global energy company. It was a fun experience, and I felt that I had fewer walkouts than some of the other talks I attended, so success! Shout out to [@altazvalani](https://twitter.com/altazvalani?lang=en) for the help and guidance.

[Slideshare link](https://www.slideshare.net/SpencerKochCISSP/houseccon-2019-offensive-security-starting-from-scratch) for slides. [Vimeo link](https://vimeo.com/showcase/5933070/video/331867408) for the actual talk.

Looking forward to doing more talks. I really believe in giving back to the infosec community and sharing with others what has and hasn't worked for me in this crazy game. Now to just keep that imposter syndrome at bay...
